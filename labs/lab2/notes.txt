Reflection q 1:
The render function must be a pure function of props and the component state, the values returned by useState(). 
What happens if the output of the render function is depending on other data that changes over time?
    react relies on changes in state or props to decide if it should re-render a component
    so, if the output depends on other data it will not update if the data changes

reflection q 2:
In the code above, the foundations array is computed every time
the component is rendered. The inventory changes very infrequent so you might think this
is inefficient. Can you cache foundations so it is only computed when props.inventory
changes?
    We could use useEffect and specify inventory as the second param. Then, React would compute the foundations array
    only when inventory is updated. But this would also cause a re-render every time

reflection q 3:
What triggers React to call the render function and update the DOM?
    Render function is called when state or props change. So either, 
    when we use setState or when a parent component passes down new props

reflection q 4: When the user changes the HTML form state (DOM), does this change the state of your component?
    Not automatically, the user can check a checkbox and nothing will happen if we haven't implemented the handling of the event.
    So, we need to make sure changes to the dom are reflected in our component by using onChange events or similar

reflection q 5:
What is the value of this in the event handling call-back functions?
    Typically it would be undefined, as in react, you should use arrow functions to handle events

Reflection q 6: 
How is the prototype chain affected when copying an object with copy = {...sourceObject}?  
    We're creating a new object with the same properties as sourceObject, so it's not connected to the old object's prototype chain any more.
    Properties that are copied over might still have a connection?
